# User stories


## All the screens
- [ ] As a user, I want to create new memories. (all the screens)
- [ ] When creating memory, I want to give them tags, e.g. leetcode 3, it is {blind 75, amazon, strings}

## Today's review screen
- [ ] As a user, I want to know what memories I want to review today. (today's review screen)
- [ ] As a user, I want to remove a card (mark as reviewed) when I finish reviewing that card (today's review screen)
- [ ] As a user, I am able to create different types of card, e.g. (daily card(need to do every day), general task), and 
different types of card have different background so it's clear.
- [ ] For each card, I want to see how many times I reviewed it, e.g. 3rd, or 3/18

### No urgent
- [ ] As a user, if I accidentally review a memory, I can withdraw (no urgent)
  - maybe count, if more than 5 seconds, then disappear

## Home screen (Data visualization screen)
- [ ] As a user, I want to know review data of each memory, e.g., memory 1 reviewed 5/8, review rate 62.5%
- [ ] As a user, I want to categorize tasks, and see how many I finished for each category



## Calendar screen
- [ ] As a user, I want to have a calendar to know what I need to review everyday (calendar screen)
- [ ] As a user, I want to see all tests for everyday in a calendar

## Catch up screen
- [ ] As a user, for all the tasks I missed, I want to catch up them



## No urgent
- [ ] As a user I want to change my review time cycle, like not from 00 to 00
but from 10 - 10
- [ ] As a user, I am able to reset curve of a specific memory 
- [ ] As a user, I want to know how long I spent on each card, default is 0
- [ ] The user has bunches of card need to review each day, but for a specific problem, let's say coding problem, the user feels overwhelmed to review all of them, but if user know there is a limit let's say at most 10 problem, then user feels motivated again!! User wants to see estimate time / number of task they will review for a day.

  - But I feel the reason is because they are worried they cannot catch up again in the future, but once they know they have a catch-up screen to review these tasks, it's not a problem.
