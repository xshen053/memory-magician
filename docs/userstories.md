- [ ] I want to see how long I spent today on all the tasks

### metrics

- different tags: task number

- [x] As a user, I want to see all tasks on the calendar, but use strikethrough for task I reviewed
- [ ] for passed tasks, change background color to some obvious color
- [ ] for today, the background becomes more obvious


## Catch up screen
- [ ] As a user, for all the tasks I missed, I want to catch up them

## Search Screen
- [x] Also search a task I created
- [x] I want to update, change, search a task
- [x] delete


## No urgent
- [ ] As a user I want to change my review time cycle, like not from 00 to 00
but from 10 - 10
- [ ] As a user, I am able to reset curve of a specific memory 
- [ ] As a user, I want to know how long I spent on each card, default is 0
- [ ] The user has bunches of card need to review each day, but for a specific problem, let's say coding problem, the user feels overwhelmed to review all of them, but if user know there is a limit let's say at most 10 problem, then user feels motivated again!! User wants to see estimate time / number of task they will review for a day.

  - But I feel the reason is because they are worried they cannot catch up again in the future, but once they know they have a catch-up screen to review these tasks, it's not a problem.
