# How Users Benefit

I have been using this application since last august, and I combine it with Anki.

The result is to be honest, incrediable. It is a reminder for me every day to tell me what I should memorize and review every day. And During the second half of last year. Since August, I have been refreshing memories every day. This is a memory palace for me.
